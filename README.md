# Kenya Delivers

Kenya Delivers is a web application platform for Kenyan Government websites.

We are a safe space for Kenyan citizens to access their government services online, tenders and keep track of their politicians's performance to
enable better voting. 

### Technology

We're building the web platform using Python's Django web framework.
